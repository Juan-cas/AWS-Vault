# Asset Classification


Asset classification is the practice of labeling assets depending on the importance or sensitivity for the company,
either of those factors can vary but in order to be able to evaluate them we must know:

- ### What you have
- ### Where it is
- ### Who owns it
- ### How important it is


an organization must use these to evaluate their assets, based on the results the organization will determine the sensitivity and value of those assets.

## Common asset classification

Asset classification allows organizations to apply their risk management policies, also it allows them to prioritize security resources reduce IT costs and stay in compliance with legal regulations.

The most common classification scheme is:
- ### Restricted
- ### Confidential
- ### Internal-only
- ### Public

How this is applied depends entirely on the characteristics of each asset, It may come as a surprise but many times the most difficult thing to do is find the owner of an asset.

This is usually applied to most organizations but several may treat their asset classification differently according to their internal asset classification.

## Challenges of classifying information

Identifying the owner of certain assets may be easy to do, for example the owner of a building or a car, since the information is already readily available in registries, but for assets such as information it may prove to be trickier.

for example what happens if a company gives a worker a laptop to remote work in it, we assume that the company owns the information inside of the laptop but what happens if said worker decide to for example, save on the laptop their personal photos.
