Is a managed cluster platform that simplifies running big data frameworks, such as [Apache Hadoop](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/details/hadoop) and [Apache Spark](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/details/spark), on AWS to process and analyze vast amounts of data. Using these frameworks and related open-source projects, you can process data fro analytics purposes and business intelligence workloads.
