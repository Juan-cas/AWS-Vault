# Identify

Create an inventory of organizational systems, processes, assets, data, people, and capabilities that need to be secured:

- Technology/asset Management: Which hardware devices, operating systems, and software were affected ? Trace the flow of the attack through the internal network.
- Process/business environment: Which business processes were affected in the attack?
- People: Who needs access to the affected systems?

It is importante to take the time needed to properly identify the attack and the attack surface that was hit in order to try and find better ways to recude or harden said surface.
