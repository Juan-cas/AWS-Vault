# Detect

	Design and implement a system with tools needed for detecting threats and attacks:

- Anomalies and events: What tools could be used to detect and alert IT security staff of anomalies and security events, such as a security information and event management system (SIEM) tool?
- Security continuous monitoring: What tools or IT processes are needed to monitor the network for security events?
- Detection process: What tools are needed to detect security events, such as an IDS?

	This must be handled as a prevention/reaction core part of your plans when making proposal guided by NIST.
