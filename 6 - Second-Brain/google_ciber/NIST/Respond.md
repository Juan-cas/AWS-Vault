# Respond

Design action plans for responding to threats and attacks:

- Response planning: What action plans need to be implemented to respond to similar attacks in the future?
- Communications: How will security event response procedures be communicated within the organization and with those directly affected by the attack, including end users and IT staff?
- Analysis: What analysis steps should be followed in response to a similar attack?
- Mitigation: What responding steps could be used to mitigate the impact of an attack, such as off-lining or isolating affected resources?
- Improvements: What improvements are needed to improve response procedures in the future?

 The respond part of NIST is focussed entirely on future prevention and faster responses to attacks, it is important to keep in mind and implement all that we have found in the previous steps and focus that into the future to improve our response time and reduce our attack area.
