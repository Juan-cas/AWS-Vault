# Applying the NIST CSF

In NIST there are five core functions of the NIST CSF framework: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.

These core functions allow companies to handle the cyber security part of their business according to the standard and learn from previous mistakes, but plans based on this framework need to be updated to stay ahead of the latest security threats. this allows organizations to be protected against potential threats, risks, vulnerabilities, each of them can be used to improve an organization's security:

- [Identify](obsidian://open?vault=GluGlu&file=6%20-%20Second-Brain%2Fgoogle_ciber%2FNIST%2FIdentify): Manage security risks through regular audits of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges to identify potential gaps in security.
- [Protect](obsidian://open?vault=GluGlu&file=6%20-%20Second-Brain%2Fgoogle_ciber%2FNIST%2FProtect): Develop a strategy to protect internal assets through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cyber-security threats.
- [Detect](obsidian://open?vault=GluGlu&file=6%20-%20Second-Brain%2Fgoogle_ciber%2FNIST%2FDetect): Scan for potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detection.
- [Respond](obsidian://open?vault=GluGlu&file=6%20-%20Second-Brain%2Fgoogle_ciber%2FNIST%2FRespond): Ensure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize and analyze security incidents and implement improvements to the security process.
- [Recover](obsidian://open?vault=GluGlu&file=6%20-%20Second-Brain%2Fgoogle_ciber%2FNIST%2FRecover): Return affected systems back to normal operations and restore systems data and assets that have been affected by an incident.
