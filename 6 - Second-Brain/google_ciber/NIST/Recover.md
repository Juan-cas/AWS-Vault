# Recover

	Construct a plan and implement the framework for recovering and restoring affected systems and/or data:

- Recovery planning: How will resources be restored following an attack?
- Improvements: Do any improvements need to be made to the current recovery systems or processes?
- Communications: How will restoration procedures be communicated within the organization and with those directly affected by the attack, including end users and IT staff?

 It is important to fully utilize all the information gathered from the previous steps in order to fully recover and also to be able to communicate it to the stacke-holders.
