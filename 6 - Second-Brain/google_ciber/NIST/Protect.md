# Protect

Develop and implement safeguards to protect the identified items and ensure delivery of services:

- Access control: Who needs access to the affected items? how are non-trusted sources blocked from having access?
- Awareness/Training: Who needs to be made aware of this attack and how to prevent it from happening again?
- Data security: Is there any affected data that needs to be made more secure?
- Information protection and procedures: Do any procedures need to be updated or added to protect data assets?
- Maintenance: Do any of the affected hardware, operating systems or software need to be updates?
- Protective technology: Are there any protective technologies, like a firewall or an intrusion prevention system (IDS), that should be implemented to protect against future attacks?

 It is important that while we are using [Identify](obsidian://open?vault=GluGlu&file=6%20-%20Second-Brain%2Fgoogle_ciber%2FNIST%2FIdentify) we also keep an eye for anything extra we may need to protect, update or secure.
