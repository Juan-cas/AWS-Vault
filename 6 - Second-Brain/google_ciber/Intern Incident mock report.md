# Intern Incident report
#### Summary

	An intern lost access to his account due to a phishing attack done, and the account was used in our networks before the report since several clients information was either deleted or manipulated in the databse.

#### Identify

	After auditing the systems, devices, and access policies involved in the attack to identify the gaps in security it was found that the only gap exploited was the credentials obtained by the malicious actors using the phishing attack.

#### Protect

	The team implemented a new authentication policies to prevent future attacks: multi-factor authentication (MFA), login attempts limited to three tries, and training for all employees on how to protect login credentials, aditionally the implementation of an intrusion prevention system (IPS).

#### Detect

	In order to detect new unauthorized access attacks in the future, the utilization of the Intrusion prevention system will be done.

#### Respond

	The team disabled the intern's network account. we provided training to interns and employees on how to protect login credentials in the future. We informed upper management of this event and they will contact our customers by mail to inform them about the data breach. Management will also need to inform law enforcement and other organizations as required by local laws.

#### Recover

	The team will recover the deleted data by restoring the database from last night's full backup. we have informed staff that any customer information entered or changed this morning would not be recorded on the backup. So, they will need to re-enter that information into the database once it has been restored from alst night's backup
