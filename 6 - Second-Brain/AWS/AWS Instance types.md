# AWS Instance types


The spot instances of Amazon EC2 allows the utilization of the EC2 capacity that hasn't been used and are available with up to 90% lower price than other On-Demand EC2 prices.

The main issue is that it will depend on if the cloud needs the computing power or not, thus it could lead to interruptions in case the other EC2 services need the computing power your Spot Instance is using.
