# Amazon simple notification Service

Is a managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers).

Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel.

Clients can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type, such as Amazon Data Firehose, Amazon SQS AWS Lambda, HTTP, Email, Mobile push notifications, and mobile text messages (SMS).
