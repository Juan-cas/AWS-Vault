# Amazon RedShift

Redshift is a fully managed Data Warehouse that is able to handle petabytes of data in the cloud.

Amazon Redshift Server-less lets you access and analyze all of your data without having to do the configurations of a provisioned data warehouse since resources are provisioned and capacity is intelligently scaled to ensure the delivery of fast performance even on the most unpredictable workloads.

Regardless of the size of the dataset Redshift offers a fast query performance using the same SQL-based tools and business intelligence applications that you use today.
