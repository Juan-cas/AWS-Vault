# Amazon FSx  (File Server Service)

Is a fully managed file Server Service that is integrated with the rest of AWS, thus you don't need to manage the hardware or the software to provide file server services to your users. 

AWS will take care of managing the hardware in terms of setting up the hardware and the servers and the volumes so you don't have to monitor and maintain them.
