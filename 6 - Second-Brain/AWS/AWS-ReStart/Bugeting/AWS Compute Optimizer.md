# AWS Compute Optimizer

It is a service that analyzes your AWS resources configuration and utilization metrics to provide you with rightsizing recommendations, it reports whether your resources are optimal, and generates optimization recommendations to reduce the cost and improve the performance of your workloads.

`Compute Optimizer`
Also provides graphs showing recent utilization metric history data, as well as projected utilization for recommendations, which you can use to evaluate which recommendation provides the best price-performance trade-off. The analysis and visualization of your usage patterns can help you decide when to move or resize your running resources, and still meet your performance and capacity requirements.

It also provides a [console experience](https://console.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer), and a [set of APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) that allows you to view the findings of the analysis and recommendations for your resources across multiple AWS Regions, you can also view findings and recommendations across multiple accounts, if you opt in the management account of an organization, the findings from the service are also reported in the consoles of the supported services, such as the Amazon EC2 console.
