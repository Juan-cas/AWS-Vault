# AWS X-Ray

Is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves, and provides tools that you can use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization.

For any traced requests to your application, you can see detailed information not only about the request and response, but also about calls that your application makes to downstream AWS resources, micro-services, databases, and web APIs
