# VPC Flow Logs

Is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC, Flow long data can be published to the following locations: Amazon Cloudwatch logs, Amazon S3, or Amazon Data Firehose.

After you create a flow log, you can retrieve and view the flow log records in the log group, bucket, or delivery stream that you configured.

flow logs can help you with a number of tasks, such as:

- **Diagnosing overly restrictive security group rules**
- **Monitoring the traffic that is reaching your instance**
- **Determining the direction of the traffic to and form the network interfaces.**
