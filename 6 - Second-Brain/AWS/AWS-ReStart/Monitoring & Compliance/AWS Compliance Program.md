# AWS Compliance Program

AWS continually maintains a high bar for security and compliance across all of our global operations, Security is our top priority. AWS regularly undergoes independent third-party attestation audits to provide assurance that control activities are operating as intended.

More specifically, AWS is audited against a variety of global and regional security frameworks dependent on region and industry. Currently, AWS offers over 300 security, compliance, and governance services and features. AWS supports 143 security standards and compliance certifications.

The result of these audits are documented by the assessing body and made available for all AWS customers through AWS Artifact.
