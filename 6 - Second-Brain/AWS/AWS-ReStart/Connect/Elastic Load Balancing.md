# Elastic Load Balancing

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, in one or more Availability Zones, It monitors the health of its registered targets and routes traffic only to the healthy targets.

You can select the type of load balancer that best suits your needs.
