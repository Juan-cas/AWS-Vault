# Amazon API gateway

Is a AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring and securing REST, HTTP and Web-socket API's at any scale.

API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the [AWS cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/).

As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers.
