# Amazon Cloud-front

Is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users.

Cloud-front delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations.

When a user requests content that you're serving with Cloud-front, the request is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
