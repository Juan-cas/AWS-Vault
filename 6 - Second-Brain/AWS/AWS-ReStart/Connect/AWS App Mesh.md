# AWS App Mesh

I a service mesh that makes it easy to monitor and control services.

A service mesh is an infrastructure layer dedicated to handling service-to-service communication, usually through an array of lightweight network proxies deployed alongside the application code.

App Mesh standardizes how your services communicate, giving you end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high availability for your applications.

App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every service in an application.
