# AWS Elastic Beanstalk


With elastic beanstalk you can quickly deply and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS comprises over one hundred services, each of which exposes an area of functionality.

While the variety of services offers flexibility for how you want to manage your AWS infrastructure, it can be challenging to figure out which services to use and how to provision them. Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. you simply upload your application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring.

Elastic Beanstalk supports applications developed in Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby. Elastic Beanstalk also supports Docker platforms. With Docker containers you can choose your own programming language and application dependencies that may not be supported by the other Elastic Beanstalk patforms.

When you deploy your application, Elastic Beanstalk builds the selected supported platform version and provisions one or more AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instance, in your AWS account to run your application.

An example of how it works:
