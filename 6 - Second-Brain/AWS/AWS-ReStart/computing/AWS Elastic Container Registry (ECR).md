# AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

is an AWS managed container image registry service that is secure, scalable, and reliable.

Amazon ECR supports private repositories with resource-based permissions using AWS IAM. This is so that specified users or Amazon EC2 instances can access your container repositories and images.

You can use your preferred CLI to push, pull and manage Docker images, Open Container Initiative (OCI) images, and OCI compatible artifacts.

The AWS container services team maintains a public roadmap on GitHub. It contains information about what the teams are working on and allows all AWS customers the ability to give direct feedback.

## Features of Amazon ECR

- Life-cycle policies help with managing the life-cycle of the images in your repositories. You can define rules that result in the cleaning up of unused images. you can test rules before applying them to your repository. for more information, see [Automate the cleanup of images by using life-cycle policies in Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/LifecyclePolicies.html).

- Image scanning helps in identifying software vulnerabilities in your container images. Each repository can be configured to scan on push. This ensures that each new image pushed to the repository is scanned. You can then retrieve the results of the image scan. For more information, see [Scan images for software vulnerabilities in Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html).

- Cross-Region and Cross-Account replication makes it easier for you to have your images where you need them. This is configured as registry setting and in on a per-region basis. For more information, See [Private registry settings in Amazon ECR](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry-settings.html).

- Pull through cache rules provide a way to cache repositories in an upstream registry in your private Amazon ECR registry. Using a pull through cache rule, Amazon ECR will periodically reach out to the upstream registry to ensure the cached image in your Amazon ECR private registry is up to date. For more information, see see [Sync an upstream registry with an Amazon ECR private registry](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/pull-through-cache.html).
