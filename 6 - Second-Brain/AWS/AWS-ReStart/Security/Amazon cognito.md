# Amazon cognito

Is an identity platform for web and mobile apps. It's a user directory, an authentication server, and an authorization service for OAuth 2.0 access tokens and AWS credentials.

With Amazon Cognito, you can authenticate and authorize users from the built-in user directory, from your enterprise directory, and from consumer identity providers like google and Facebook.
