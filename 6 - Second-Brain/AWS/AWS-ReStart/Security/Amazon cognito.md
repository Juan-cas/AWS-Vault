	Amazon Cognito is an identity platform for web and mobile applications. It serves as a user directory and authentication server, managing user sign-up, sign-in, and access control. Additionally, it supports social identity providers such as Google and Facebook, allowing users to authenticate using their existing accounts. Cognito also handles credentials and token management for authorized access to your applications.
